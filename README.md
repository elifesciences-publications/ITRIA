# ITRIA
Interactive Tracking roGFP Image Analysis

The ITRIA is a MATLAB based image analysis tool for cell tracking and roGFP measurements over time of individual cells, developed by Avia Mizrachi, in the lab of Assaf Vardi at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

First, enter the correct variables in the “varsFunc.m” file.
Then, use the “itria.m” script and go over step by step.
Further user instructions are found within the scripts and in the user guide folder.
